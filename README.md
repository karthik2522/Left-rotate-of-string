CONTRIBUTION:
My team members including me seperately have wrritten our own codes on our own logic. After 
writing the codes we discussed among our selves and analysed the codes made corrections in the code 
and we executed all the three codes we find some logical error in the codes by comparing all three codes 
we corrected and make a single code and executed the code at last we got the out put.
The code was written in c language so we can execute the code normally
Challenges faced and addressing problems:-
Many errors occurred because of missing  logics
We cleared our errors one by one and got the output and we struggled for lot of time

INSTRUCTION TO RUN PROGRAM :
1> Use the Java IDE like eclipse,netbeans 
2> create class Asn02P09
3> Run the code

CHALLENGES FACED :
1>We didnt used the google logics
2>We tried lot 
3>Each in a team have given good ideas to implement this program
4>All the persons in the team worked good 
5>we discussed and implemented day by day
